'As a beginner you have many options to start running OoT. Here are some suggestions:\n\n\
GSR: This category is very commonly recommended to beginners. It involves completing Shadow, Spirit, \
and most of Forest before beating the game. It will teach you a lot of fundamentals that carry over to \
more advanced categories. One downside often mentioned about this category is the high cutscene \
content. There is a tutorial in the resources channel.\n\n\
Any%: This run is the simplest introduction to SRM, and the shortest category overall. SRM may look \
confusing and complicated, but it\'s only hard if you have to explain it. It\'s actually very simple to perform, \
and since the run is so short, there\'s very little you need to learn. If being able to say you beat \
OoT in under 5 minutes seems fun to you, then this is a great category to try. Check the pins in the Any% Q/A \
channel for tutorials.\n\n\
Glitchless AMQ: This category is great to start with because it focuses mostly on movement, and exposes you \
to a lot of the game, giving you good foundations for other runs. It\'s long, but if you are okay with learning a lot, \
this is a great starting point. This category has a lot of cutscenes, but also a ton of gameplay to balance it out. \
Don\'t confuse it with Glitchless Any%, which is still great but much harder! Check the glitchless routing \
channel pins for route docs, savestates, and other resources.\n\n\
Defeat Ganon (Classic Kakariko Route): If you want a short run without SRM, this one is perfect. The most \
beginner-friendly route gets the Kokiri Sword, gets the Kakariko cucco bottle and wrong warps from Deku Tree. \
A tutorial for the route is in the defeat-ganon Q/A channel pins! Note that the linked tutorial \
does Triple Slash Clip for Collapse Skip near the end, which is not allowed in the Classic Kakariko route ruleset.\n\n\
You can start with any category, these are just the most commonly suggested ones. \
In the end you should run what you find most interesting. There are also other non-RTA options like Bingo!')

	async def cspointer(self, ctx):

'Specific cutscenes will set a value which is very important for wrong warps called the “Cutscene Pointer”. \
In the context of a Defeat Ganon speedrun, this value is last set by the cutscene that plays when you enter the Deku Tree.\n\
If for whatever reason you need to reset the game after that cutscene, your CS Pointer gets set to the value for the title \
screen cutscene. Having this CS Pointer will mean that you will softlock after successfully performing the wrong warp.\n\
Luckily there is an easy way to fix this. Depending on your version, you can pause in a specific area to fix the relevant \
values. The fix is language and version specific. For the Japanese version:\n\
> 1.0 - pause the game in Link’s house\n\
> 1.1 - pause the game in House of Twins\n\
> 1.2 - pause the game in Link’s house\n\
After you have paused and unpaused the game in this location, the wrong warp will work again as long as your CS Pointer is \
still the title screen. \nA long explanation on the pause trick can be found here: <https://pastebin.com/WEkVWVWt>\n\
Also note: on the Practice ROM you can go to `warps > clear cs pointer` and it will make any wrong warp work regardless of your last cutscene.')

This is important for performing the Wrong Warp, because if Link doesn’t walk through the door at the right speed at the end of \
the setup, the warp timer value will not be correct.\n\n\
In a run context, the last loading zone before Gohma is entering The Deku Tree. This loading zone has a hard coded speed. No matter \
how fast or slow you enter it, it is the same. This means in runs you have nothing to worry about. However, in practice, if you warp to \
Gohmas room with the Practice ROM, chances are your warp speed is off and it will not work. You need to warp to Deku Tree *then* warp to \
Gohma for your loading zone speed value to be correct.')

snap you to their angle automatically.\n\
For any other wall, simply pressing target might work, and might not depending on your exact position. For these, \
the only way to guarantee it to work is to have *passive* momentum into the wall when you press target. This means \
that Link should be moving without you holding the analog stick. The fast way to do this is to hold forward into the \
wall, then release the analog stick and press target in the couple of frames when Link is still moving. This can be \
tricky to get used to. The easy and slow way is to simply do a neutral roll against the wall, and press target during \
the roll.\n Some things you should never do are spam target, or hold forward while targeting. Holding forward will \
continually make Link face forward, ruining whatever wall angle you were trying to get.')
